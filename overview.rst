.. note::
   This extension is under the active development even though Adobe dropped the support for Magento 1.x e-commerce platform (Jul 1st, 2020). Creativestyle will provide the necessary updates and support for this extension as long as this extension will be used by the active Amazon Pay merchants.

Overview
========

This extension provides an official integration of your Magento store with **Amazon Pay** service. They help your customers shop quickly, safely and securely. Your customers can pay on your website without re-entering their payment and address details. All Amazon transactions are protected by Amazon's A-to-z Guarantee.

The extension is a pure payment solution. No item level is communicated to Amazon Payments and it allows you to manage your orders directly from Magento.

The performance is continually optimised by technology, learnings, and best practises from Amazon.
