**Is Amazon Pay (Checkout v2) extension compatible with Magento 1.x?**

Amazon Pay (Checkout v2) extension is implemented for and tested against `OpenMage <https://www.openmage.org>`_ platform, which is a community-driven successor of Magento 1.x, thus, it is very likely that this extension works properly on Magento 1.x as well. Please note that the official support for Magento 1.x has been dropped, so the extension may be used on Magento 1.x on the merchant's sole risk and no support will be provided in case of platform incompatibilities.
